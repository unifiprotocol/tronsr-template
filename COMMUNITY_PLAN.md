Unifi believes the power of DeFi is in the hands of the community.  Unifi’s multi-chain and multi-service DeFi ecosystem is governed by the community through the UNFI token.  Our community-first approach to staking mirrors our revolutionary fee structure on uTrade which also shares 100% of the trading fees with liquidity providers. 

On select blockchains, uStake will allow stakers to claim their rewards as UP. UP is automatically minted by smart contract on multiple blockchains and backed by the base token fees and node rewards generated by the Unifi Protocol on each chain. UP is redeemable at any time for those tokens. A portion of the base tokens are used to increase the redeem value every time new UP is minted, so UP has a redeem value that can never go down. That’s why it’s called “UP!”
