Unifi Protocol is a group of interoperable smart contracts linking multiple blockchain economies together into one large DeFi marketplace.  Unifi’s Global Governance token (UNFI) provides community governance, exclusive access to protocol rewards, and can be staked to the protocol to earn staking rewards.  Native token staking to Unifi’s blockchain nodes offers the unique opportunity to participate in a blended ecosystem where PoS stakers, lenders, liquidity providers, and DeFi projects all benefit from shared goals and a shared tokenomics ecosystem.  Blockchain stakers have the option to claim their node rewards as UP, the blockchain-specific utility token of the Unifi Protocol.  UP is 100% backed by the base tokens collected by the Protocol, and has a redeem rate that rises over time.
